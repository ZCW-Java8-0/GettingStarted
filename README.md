# Getting Started


**Important**: It should go without saying that anytime you are asked to create an account you should ALWAYS:

* *Make sure to use a professional username/handle.* We recommend the username incorporates your name. 
* Be sure to add an appropriate avatar (picture or image) to your profile. 


### Passwords

Consider a password manager like [enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) or [lastpass](https://lastpass.com/) to manage all of your accounts. (This way you can keep track of your Admin password for MySQL, which I guarantee you will otherwise forget.)
